Presentation Script

note to jackie: make an outline of the presentation, then write the script

prompt: write a narrative for each visualization -> what can you say about each one, what they say about music trends, what that means, analysis

note to jackie: 10 minute long script -> time it

Hello, welcome to our presentation about Spotify Data Visualizations, I'm [introduction of everyone here]
Our group focused on analyzing top music trends between 1998 and 2020

~ ~ ~ Project Goals ~ ~ ~ 
Our project's main objective was to analyze the Spotify dataset and discern any notable patterns or trends from it
Some specific goals we had in mind included how different music variables vary across time and genre
  Music variables here refer to different ways to measure or quantify a song, including beats per minute (bpm or tempo), or loudness (measured in decibels dB)
  We wanted specifically to see how 


Specific Goals: 
  Investigae how music variables such as speechiness, acousstiness, energy (etc) vary across time and genre. 
  Investigate how explicitness varies across time and genre
  Investigate how song duration changes across time and genre. 
Generate interactive visualizations that effectively communicate trends

Overall Objective: Understand and analyze Spotiify music dataset patterns and trends
Specific Goals: 
Investigae how music variables such as speechiness, acousstiness, energy (etc) vary across time and genre. 
Investigate how explicitness varies across time and genre
Investigate how song duration changes across time and genre. 
Generate interactive visualizations that effectively communicate trends


how create database, how set it up, how transform it, clean up,

DRAFT V!
interactive #1
genre -> average metric : change in metric over time for genre
The first interactive set of charts has users select genre and then a metric 
it shows each genre and metric over to track changes in the genre over time
music evolves and changes, what is 'pop' in the past is relative to its time -> show changes like duration
can track evolutions in music over the past two decades -> music branches into different genres, or different genres are popular
pop ->  a contemporary form of music that appeals to a very wide audience -> genre shifts from decade to decade 80s rock to 90s boybands 



interactive #2
genre : count of songs over time 
might reflect popularity of certain genres over time ->
